* Dark universe conference (20+10 or 25+5 min - relatively short! - about 25 slides?)
* Heidelberg cares about dark energy => Will be lensing-oriented
* Present ACT and preliminary ACTPol lensing results
* Experiment -> TOD -> map estimation -> power spectrum and lensing estimation
	* Importance of high resolution
	* Delensing? No, not for ACT and probably not for AdvAct
* Cross-correlation
	* Galaxy bias
* Other dark stuff: Neutrino mass, neutrino species
* State of the art + projections (AdvActpol etc.)
* Primordial B-modes?
	* Planck results will be out by then
